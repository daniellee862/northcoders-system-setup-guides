# How to setup up your WSL dev environment

First things first here's a little tip that with dramatically improve your experience when using the command line.

## 1. Open your Ubuntu terminal

Open up **Ubuntu** from the start menu if you haven't already got it open - **This is the only terminal that you should be using from now on**

Then right click on the top bar and select _properties_. In the properties you can check the box which will enable you to use `CTRL-C` and `CTRL-V` shortcuts on the command line.

Now the above is done this next step will be much easier.

## 2. Install Git, NVM & Node

Please copy and paste the following into your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install git && curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash && source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm install node && nvm use node &&  git config --global credential.helper store
```

Then hit return.

This will install the following things:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## 3. Install Postgres.

Please copy and paste the following into your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

Then hit return again, this will install [PSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

A few more steps and we're done!

1. Enter the command: `sudo passwd postgres`
2. You will get a prompt to create a new password for postgres - this is different to your Windows login. After this please close and re-open your terminal.
3. One more command to run in the terminal: `sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $USER && sudo -u postgres createdb $USER`. You will likely be asked for the password that you just created.

> If you see the following error: `Could not connect to server/database...` or similar, run the following command to ensure that the postgresql server is running before trying the above again:
>
> ```bash
> sudo service postgresql start
> ```

Finally enter `psql` in your terminal and you should see something like this:

```bash
YOUR_USERNAME_HERE=#
```

You can exit Postgres by typing `\q` and hitting return.

## Visual Studio Code

As part of the course preparation you will be asked to install VSCode. You may already have it installed.

When using WSL it is important that you have access the the `code` command for opening folders in VSCode. The reason for this is that because **you will not be able to view your files in the Windows file explorer**.

When installing Visual Studio Code you should be prompted to **Select Additional Tasks**, make sure you select the "_Add to PATH_" setting.

Additionally you will need to install the [Remote Development extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) as an extensions to your VSCode.

Details on the steps above can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl).

And that's everything you need to get started! 🎉

**Going forward please only use the Ubuntu terminal or the integrated WSL terminal in VSCode**

If you want to use the integrated terminal in VSCode make sure it's the right kind. It is likely that it might assume you want to use PowerShell - _**you shouldn't need to use PowerShell at all**_.

You can switch to Ubuntu/WSL by selecting the drop down arrow next to the plus sign and choosing **Ubuntu(WSL)**:

After doing this your terminal should now look something like this:
